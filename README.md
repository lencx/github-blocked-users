# github-blocked-users

In my [Noi](https://github.com/lencx/Noi) project, the issues section has been overwhelmed by a wave of malicious comments, and this issue is spreading to other open-source projects as well.

This repository provides a list of usernames to help others block these accounts efficiently. If you identify similar users, contributions are welcome. Open source is a collaborative effort, and we hope these malicious activities can be curbed in time to prevent further burden on developers. 

For guidance on how to block users, please refer to the [GitHub - Blocking a user from your personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account).
